# MISC-II Reference Implementation

In this folder, you can find the reference implementation of MISC-II in C++ language while avoiding using standard library functions to preserve its high-level-synthesizability. It can be ensured to be correct, while being extremely inefficient, so DO NOT use it in production directly. You may optimize the code or write your own implementation.
